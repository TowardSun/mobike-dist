# Mobike Distribution Inference (TKDE)

> Inferring dockless shared bike distributions in new cities by transfering the knowledge from the cities popular with the dockless shared bikes.

Keras implementation for the paper **'Inferring Dockless Shared Bike Distribution in New cities'**, which was publised on the WSDM 2018.

Foreknowing the dockless shared bike distributions in a new city is of great significance for the design of the bike delivering strategy, government regulations, renewing the traffic rules, and so on. In this paper, based on the multi-source data and known bike distirbutions in the delivered cities, we employed the convolutional neural network to model the interaction between geo-related information and the bike distributions, and then applied this learnt knowledge to the target city to infer the potential dockless shared bike distributions.


## DataSet

We collect muliple geo-related data from differet sources, including:
 
 * Mobike data (by crawler);
 * POI data from ([Baidu Map](http://lbsyun.baidu.com)); 
 * Satellite light ([Light Polution](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info));  
 * Road network ([OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org));
 * Transportation hubs (collect manually);
 * Business centers ([Fliggy](https://www.fliggy.com));

If you're interested in these data, you can crawl or get the data from our provided urls.
